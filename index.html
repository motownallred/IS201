                            <h3 class="post-subtitle">Things that made and still make Georgia feel like my forever home</h3>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Humidity - I could never curl my hair, but my skin was so hydrated that I practically glowed. The warm rain in the summertime is such a pleasant experience; you just succome to warmness surrounding every inch of your body.</li>
                                <li>Bugs - I have so many good memories of collecting lizards, frogs, roly polies, and snakes. It was gross, but me and the bugs lived together, and it colored my childhood with vibrant experiences. We were friends. </li>
                                <li>Hickory Hill Farm - My grandparents house holds so many dear memories. My grandpa with his raging azala that covered every inc of the backyard. My grandma cooking her special pankcakes for me and my cousins. Being terrified for my life, sitting in the bedroom with candles burning during tornadoe warnings. Playing Spot-It with my grandma evey second she could spare. Christmases and Birthdays galore. And of course, I cannot forget "Ranger," the resident farm dog. That house still holds my little girl heart.</li>
                                <li>Whitewater - Going to Whitewater Middle School and High School was a dream. The school colors were red and white and the mascot was a bobcat, just like in High School Musical. Education is a really high priority for Georgians, so the schools were well-funded and I got an excellent quality education while I was there. It carries so many memories, including when I had to say goodbye to my friends and move accross the country to Idaho at only 16 years old.</li>
                                <li>Chick-fil-A - Chick-fil-A started in Fayettville, where I lived, so it was widley celerated and almost worshipped. We had a pizza themed and hawaiian themed Chick-fil-A along with a few others. I swear, Chick-fil-A truly is better in every way in Georgia, and it hasn't been the same experience since I left. They used to sell Chick-fil-A chicken biscuts in my high school and it was such a treat! The good christain people of Georgia loved supporting all that Chick-fil-A did for their community. </li>
                                <li>Family - Both of my parents grew up in Georgia and when we lived there, all of my extended family lived there too. Family dinners on both sides of the family happened virtually every Sunday. We all attended the cousin's baptisms and baby blessings, which was so sweet. Everyone has since scattered throughout the country, but I miss the days everyone was in Georgia and we were all toegther.</li>
